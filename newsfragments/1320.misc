Newly created development environments will by default check out the master branch from dials/cctbx
rather than from cctbx_project/cctbx, with the local branch name 'stable'. This branch follows the
cctbx_project/cctbx master branch, and automatically advances whenever the cctbx CI tests pass.
Therefore the checked out copy will not be known unstable.
A local pre-commit is set up to reject local commits to the stable branch. All other branches will behave normally.
One can at any time git checkout master to get access to the regular cctbx_project master
branch, and similarly check out any other branch from the cctbx_project/cctbx remote.
